Based on the current state of index-fixed.html, here are my recommendations for improving the UI and adapting it for mobile platforms as an MVP web application:
UI Improvements for index-fixed.html
1. Responsive Design Enhancements
Implement proper responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
Convert the visualization options into a dropdown menu on smaller screens
Make the input field and search button stack vertically on mobile devices

2. Mobile-First Optimizations
Increase touch target sizes for all interactive elements (minimum 44Ã—44px)
Add proper viewport meta tags if not already present
Implement touch-friendly controls for map navigation

3. User Experience Improvements
Add a clear results button to start a new search
Implement a history feature to recall previous searches
Add the ability to share results via URL or social media

4. Visual Design Updates
Create a collapsible sidebar for the debug section (hidden by default)
Implement a more modern card-based layout for results
Add subtle animations for state transitions (loading, results appearing)

5. Performance Optimizations
Lazy load map resources until needed
Implement progressive loading of visualization elements
Add offline capabilities for core functionality
